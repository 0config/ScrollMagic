###The jQuery plugin for magical scroll interactions.

ScrollMagic is a jQuery plugin which essentially lets you use the scrollbar like a progress bar.  
It's the plugin for you, if you want to ...
* ... start an animation at a specific scroll position
* ... synchronize an animation to the scrollbar movement
* ... pin an element at a specific scroll position (sticky elements)
* ... pin an element for a limited amount of scroll progress (sticky elements)
* ... easily add a parallax effect to your website
* ... create an inifinitely scrolling page (ajax load of additional content)
* ... call functions when the user hits certain scroll positions or react in any other way to the current scroll position

##About the Plugin

ScrollMagic is a complete rewrite of its predecessor [Superscrollorama](https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama) by [John Polacek](http://johnpolacek.com).  
Like Superscrollorama it relies on the [Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP)](www.greensock.com/gsap-js/) to build animations, but was developed with specific regard to former shortcomings.

The major perks of using ScrollMagic include:
* optimized performance
* flexibility
* mobile compatibility
* ready for responsive webdesign
* object oriented programming and object chaining
* event management
* support for both scroll directions (even different on one page)
* support for div containers (even multiple on one page)
* extensive debugging and logging capabilities

##Browser Support

ScrollMagic aims to support all major browsers in recent versions:  
Firefox 26+, Chrome 30+, Safari 6+, Opera 19+, IE 9+
